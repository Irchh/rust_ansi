# Rust ANSI
A very simple and bad implementation of an ANSI parser in rust. It was mostly made for learning purposes.
VERY WIP at the moment, breaking changes are coming each commit.

# Requirements:
- [Getting started - Rust Programming Language](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)
- Linux (Have not tested anywhere else, might be portable)
